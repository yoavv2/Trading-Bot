# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** Build a trustworthy, auditable trading platform that can reproducibly validate a strategy, run it in daily paper trading, and explain every action or blocked action without ambiguity.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Backtest and Reporting

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 6 (Backtest and Reporting)
Plan: 1 of 3
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-14 — Completed Phase 3 Plan 01 and advanced to deterministic runner implementation

Progress: [███████░░░] 78%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: ~7 min
- Total execution time: -

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 3 of 3 | - | - |
| 2 | 3 of 3 | - | - |
| 3 | 1 of 3 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-03, 02-01, 02-02, 02-03, 03-01 completed
- Trend: Strong momentum; backtest schema foundation is complete and runner work is active

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 02-data-and-strategy P02 | 6 | 3 tasks | 14 files |
| Phase 02-data-and-strategy P03 | 5min | 3 tasks | 8 files |
| Phase 03-backtest-and-reporting P01 | 12min | 3 tasks | 10 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Scope the first roadmap to the MVP milestone only; multi-strategy expansion and dashboard work stay in PROJECT.md as later milestones.
- [Init]: Front-load platform structure, data integrity, and auditability before adding broker automation.
- [Init]: Treat the backtest-to-paper-trading daily loop as the definition of MVP readiness.
- [02-01]: Promoted httpx from dev to runtime dependency for the Polygon client.
- [02-01]: Shortened Alembic revision ID to 0002_phase2_mdf to stay within alembic_version varchar(32) limit.
- [02-01]: Used INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE RETURNING id instead of rowcount for reliable upsert counts.
- [02-01]: Symbol rows are minimal ticker-only stubs during bar ingestion to avoid requiring a separate symbol-sync prerequisite.
- [02-01]: DailyBar uniqueness spans symbol_id + session_date + adjusted + provider for future multi-provider support.
- [Phase 02-data-and-strategy]: date_to_session(direction=previous) used instead of previous_session() — the latter requires valid session input
- [Phase 02-data-and-strategy]: Sessions persisted to market_sessions table so read queries are SQL joins, not calendar library calls
- [Phase 02-data-and-strategy]: Symbol enrichment columns nullable to allow ticker-stub rows to coexist with fully-synced rows
- [Phase 02-data-and-strategy]: Module-level bars_for_sessions import in strategy enables patch-based test isolation without DB
- [Phase 02-data-and-strategy]: TrendFollowingExitSettings typed model replaces dict exits so exit_window is a validated int
- [Phase 03-backtest-and-reporting]: `strategy_runs` remains the single run root; Phase 3 distinguishes backtests via `run_type=backtest`
- [Phase 03-backtest-and-reporting]: Run assumptions persist in `parameters_snapshot` so execution and reporting stay tied to one exact config payload
- [Phase 03-backtest-and-reporting]: Signals, trades, and equity history live in normalized child tables rather than opaque JSON blobs

### Pending Todos

- Execute Phase 3 Plan 02: Build the deterministic daily-bar backtest runner and execution flow

### Blockers/Concerns

- Docker daemon was unavailable during Phase 1 and 2-01 verification; local PostgreSQL@14 (Homebrew) used instead of Docker Compose.
- Local PostgreSQL-backed verification requires elevated sandbox access in this environment, but the Phase 3 foundation tests passed once rerun against the local database.
