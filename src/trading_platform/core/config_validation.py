"""Pure, entrypoint-agnostic config validation core.

`validate_config(payload, *, mode)` validates the RAW pre-pydantic settings
payload (as produced by `settings.build_settings_payload()`) and returns a
constructed `Settings`, or raises a single aggregated `ConfigValidationError`
naming every failed field.

Validating the raw payload — not an already-constructed `Settings` — is what
makes CFG-05 (tolerance bounds) reachable as a named validation failure.
`Settings` fields already carry pydantic `Field(ge=/le=)` bounds; if this
module validated a *constructed* `Settings` instead, a bare
`pydantic.ValidationError` would already have been raised (and the bad value
already rejected) at `Settings.model_validate()` time, before any semantic
validator here could see it. So `validate_config` owns the
`Settings.model_validate()` call itself and translates any
`pydantic.ValidationError` into a typed, field-named `ConfigValidationError`
(CFG-05, CFG-07) — it does not duplicate pydantic's declared bounds in a
hand-maintained table (that would drift).

`ExecutionMode` is a closed enum passed in explicitly by the caller. There is
deliberately no corresponding field on `Settings`: a config-file mode field
could contradict the command an entrypoint is actually running (e.g. a
paper-mode config value while `backtest` is invoked). 10-05 wires an
entrypoint-selected `mode` into this function; this module has no opinion on
where a process boots.

This module performs zero I/O — no DB, no filesystem, no logging. Wiring this
into entrypoints and translating a raised `ConfigValidationError` into
process-exit behavior is explicitly out of scope here (plan 10-05).
